Hi, I'm 0x4rm4nd

Senior backend engineer focused on designing reliable, high-throughput services and data systems. I build production systems with Python and TypeScript, with strong experience in cloud-native architecture, observability, and CI/CD.
Currently Senior Backend Engineer at [Cloud ExMachina](https://www.cloudexmachina.io/), helping teams take control of their cloud to achieve peak efficiency and performance without overspending.
